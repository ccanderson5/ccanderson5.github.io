            <h1>My Work</h1>
            <p>I have a <em>lot of hobbies</em> which leads to a <em>lot of projects</em>; some of which get 
                finished, others do not. I made a Youtube channel when I was nine and my goal 
                was to make videos of me playing games just like the people I watched on Youtube. 
                Over time that spread to me making and uploading whatever I thought was a fun 
                display of work.</p>

            <h2>The Box</h2>
            <p>My friends and I loved to try to make movies when we were in middle and high school, 
                so we eventually ended up uploading one of them in 2019. The Box went on to take 
                home Best Picture at the Oscars that year. It recently celebrated it's <strong>5th</strong> anniversary 
                in August 2024.</p>

                <h2>Calculated By Dennis</h2>
                <p>This is the most popular video on my channel by a large margin. It also makes the least 
                sense. When I was in high school, I was really into professional eSports, I even went 
                to two tournaments in 2018. 2019 came along and my favorite team had just qualified for 
                a major event, so I made a song about how their worst player was actually the only reason 
                they qualified. I wrote, recorded, and uploaded it in <strong>4 hours</strong>, and you can definitely tell.</p>

                <h2>MGFFL</h2>
            <p>In 2020, I had a lot of free time during online school and I started a little recap show 
                that was short lived about the fantasy football league my friends and I started back in 
                2017. Even though I only did a couple videos, I still thought it was a fun project I've 
                considered returning to this NFL season if time permits. You can learn more about my sports 
                interests on my <a href="index.html">About Me</a> page.</p>

                <h2>Computer Generated Art</h2>
                <p>In freshman year of high school, I took Computer Generated Art with a friend of mine. It had 
                four main projects: a magazine cover, an animation, a 3D model, and a set of emojis. My 
                personal favorite was the emoji project as I themed mine around Yung Gravy. One of the emojis
                I created has become my go to profile picture.</p>

                <h2>COMARTS 155 Website</h2>
            <p>Last year, I took COMARTS 155 with Eric Hoyt. Worth every second. We had four major projects 
                exploring different media types and creating our own. The first project was photography, then 
                podcast, then a website, and finally a group video. I feel it's only right to share my website 
                from the class on this site.</p>
