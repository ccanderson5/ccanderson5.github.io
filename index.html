            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I was really into computers and video games
                when I was a kid, so as I grew up I became set on Computer Science.
                In high school, I took a big interest in sports and did intramural basketball my 
                senior year, my first time playing an organized sport since recording one hit 
                across three seasons of rec-league baseball in middle school.</p>

            <h3>Making Media</h3>
            <p>In high school, I bought myself a new computer and it gave me a lot more 
                opportunities to make digital media than the laptop I’d had for the
                prior six years. I took a big interest in making media for fun, and I’d
                found a website that offered what was essentially Photoshop for free. I
                started making a lot of images for fun on there, and I started making
                videos for my Youtube channel for fun again. When I was really young, I
                wanted to pursue being a Youtuber as a career, but now my dream career
                is to be in charge of marketing for a sports team or brand I enjoy. I 
                took a few classes on marketing in high school, which gave me a lot of 
                opportunities to make media for tangible purposes outside of just being 
                a hobby. Nowadays, I make a variety of different media for fun such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Videos on my Youtube Channel</li>
                    <li>Art for Work or my Personal Intersts</li>
                    <li>Occasional Photoshops</li>
                </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="m-3">
            <h3>Sports</h3>
            <p>I never really had any interest in sports before high school. I played soccer 
                when I was six and quit after one year because I kicked someone in the shin 
                fighting for the ball, and they started crying. In middle school, I did 
                baseball over the summer, which I briefly referenced in the Personal Life 
                portion of this page. Once we were in quarantine, my friends and I started 
                playing football on the field nearby every Wednesday as we were off school 
                then. I started watching basketball and football religiously in sophomore 
                year of high school too, and I took a liking to the Bucks, Packers, and 
                Chargers. When the Bucks were in the finals, my friends and I would go to 
                Buffalo Wild Wings for every game, and for game six we were in the Deer 
                District. I have yet to go to my first NFL, NBA, or NHL game, but I’ve 
                been to a few Brewers games too. I don’t follow hockey or baseball too 
                closely anymore, but at one point I was trying to juggle all four major 
                sports, but for now it’s just basketball and football for me.</p>

            <h3>Video Games</h3>
            <p>I have been playing video games my entire life. I started playing games on 
                the computer when I was three, and soon after I got a DS and it spiraled 
                from there. Fifteen years later and I have a huge collection taking up a 
                whole shelf in my house. My older brother used to come over on the weekends
                and we’d play through Halo 2 on my original Xbox. My parents and I would play
                on the Wii together for an hour or so every night when I was really young. 
                I would ask my mom if I could go over to my older cousin’s house just so I 
                could play Call of Duty, since she wouldn’t let me own it. In middle school, 
                I started collecting games from garage sales and flipping the games I didn’t 
                really want on Facebook Marketplace. My collection kept on growing and it 
                funded itself with me selling off games as I bought them. For a little bit 
                during high school in between jobs, I sold video games full time online. I 
                still play a decent amount nowadays, but nothing near what I used to. I was 
                attached to Counter-Strike for a long time, to the point where my mom and I 
                took two trips, one to Chicago and the other to Boston to watch professional 
                tournaments during my freshman year of highschool. Although the amount I’ve 
                been playing video games since college started has been diminishing, I still 
                hold them to be a sizable interest of mine and I try to keep up with all of 
                the news surrounding them.</p>

            <h3>Collecting</h3>
            <p>In addition to collecting games, I have many other collections I’ve built 
                up over the years. My first collection was my coin collection, spurred on 
                by seeing my Dad’s coin collection. On the weekend, we would go to Rick’s 
                Olde Gold at the Hilldale Mall, and I would have a $5 limit, so I would 
                search and search through their clearance coins bin. The second collection 
                of mine was a little bit more out there as I somehow decided to collect 
                stamps. My stamp collection didn’t really compare to the coin collection, 
                and to this day it’s pretty small in comparison to my other collections. 
                I also didn’t get very in depth with researching stamps either, so I feel 
                that likely led to my fascination burning out so quickly with it. My third 
                collection was pins. I didn’t have a specific sort of pin I collected, but 
                I did enjoy finding older political pins because I had a major interest in 
                history at the time. After that, I began collecting video games, which I 
                talked about above. And finally, in high school, I began collecting sports 
                jerseys. I didn’t want to spend $100+, however, so my collection was mainly 
                from Facebook Marketplace and the clearance section on Fanatics. I will admit 
                I have some very obscure jerseys, like my Philip Rivers Colts jersey, but my 
                favorite has to be either my gold Hakeem Olajuwon jersey or my Kareem 
                Abdul-Jabbar Bucks jersey. In recent years, the only collections that have 
                expanded are my video game and jersey collections.</p>

            <h3>Cooking/Baking</h3>
            <p>When I was growing up, both of my parents loved to cook and bake. A
                whole section of our dining room was dedicated to cookbooks and family
                recipe binders. We would make my grandma’s recipe for Polish rice balls
                every Christmastime as a family. My parents would get me involved in
                making dinner as a kid and it made me love cooking. I love doing really
                complicated recipes, and my family is always putting in a request to
                take home my next batch of chocolate chip cookies. Now that I am out of
                dorms, I have found my love for cooking again, and it has been a
                necessity as eating out is so expensive. My girlfriend and I have been
                collecting recipes every week and trying them out since we moved in to 
                our apartments last year to keep cooking interesting.</p>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>Most people like music as well, so this interest isn’t inherently special.
                 However, I do think my personal connection to music makes it a little more
                 interesting. I listen to a wide variety of music because I got my taste 
                 from my whole family. My dad got me interested in classic rock and country, 
                 while my mom was a big fan of disco and funk, along with heavy metal. My 
                 brother’s interest in rap and my sister constantly listening to R&B in the 
                 car influenced the majority of what I listen to nowadays though. I try to 
                 branch out here and there. Most of my friend’s recommendations have come 
                 from my best friend, Adrian, who got me to start listening to newer rap, 
                 or my girlfriend getting me to listen to all of the Taylor Swift albums 
                 and rank them. I’ve also been to a few concerts over the years, which 
                 makes each of them really memorable to me. My first concert was Pitbull 
                 at Summerfest with my mom, she loved it, I had an alright time. A few 
                 years later, I saw Yung Gravy at the Majestic in Madison in 2018. I 
                 brought my CD my brother had gotten me for Christmas and he signed both
                the CD and my shoes. The next year I went to Ice Cube with two of my 
                friends and my brother at The Rave for my fourteenth birthday. Then, 
                right before college started, I saw Kendrick Lamar at Fiserv Forum with 
                my friend, Adrian. Two summers ago I went to a free Spinners concert in
                Illinois. The music I listen to has a personal connection to it, and as a 
                result has acted as a major emotional outlet for me. If you’re interested 
                in sampling my music taste, I’ve linked my Spotify right <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/trialander/playlists">here</a>.</p>
